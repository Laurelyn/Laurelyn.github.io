# Bompstable?

## "The glassblower's cat is bompstable," according to Detective Inspector Charles Parker, not yet Chief, awakening from a luxurious but at first fiercely-denied nap in Lord Peter Wimsey's London flat. 

## Perfectly ripping word, bompstable.

### If that isn't satisfactory, [I'm](https://www.laurelyncollins.us) very sorry but you'll have to take it up with Dorothy L. Sayers, and I imagine her response time to inquiries will be even more unsatisfactory. All I can offer you otherwise are the words of the Beloved Tilde: "Never eat ice cream with a fork."
