# Bompstable?

## "The glassblower's cat is bompstable," according to Detective Inspector Charles Parker, not yet Chief, awakening from a luxurious but at first fiercely-denied nap in Lord Peter Wimsey's London flat. 

## Perfectly ripping word, bompstable.

### If that isn't satisfactory, [I'm](https://www.linkedin.com/laurelyn/) very sorry but for the time being, you'll have to take it up with Dorothy L. Sayers, and I imagine her availability & responsiveness will be even less satisfactory. All I can offer you otherwise are the words of the Beloved Tilde: ["Never eat ice cream with a fork."](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rec.arts.tv.mst3k.misc/9QPli4aT-gY/IcwId19VBLYJ)
